Project description:
I started by plotting rectangles and circles playing with different angles, colors, and animations. I wanted to make sure the full animation was seen so I adjusted the width and heights enough so they were visible before and after the animations.

For the line, I played around with different animations, including it snaping out when hovering over or clicking on it, but settled with a simple horizontal line for simplicity.

The path was fun to explore because it allowed so much variability! I made geometric waves and what looked like a doodle sketch but when I found the stars I loved the uniqueness of them. I had to color them yellow, of course.
